We are analyzing data for 15 schools representing 39,170 students in the district with various sizes and budgets. 
The summary is provided in the table name Summary Per School. Overall the % overall passing rate is 65% which seems pretty low.

According the collected data, the success ration (% Overall Passing Rate) is not linked to the allocated budget. With one exception the largest schools have the lowest % Overall Passing Rate. This conclusion is confirmed by the analyzis that focuses on success rate per school size showing 53% for the largest schools and around 90% for the Medium and Small Schools.
